# Project Setup and Validation

This project includes a setup and validation script located at `doc/run_to_validate.sh`.

## `doc/run_to_validate.sh`

This script is designed to prepare the context and virtual machine environment for the project. It performs various setup tasks, installs dependencies, and configures the necessary services.

### Usage

To execute the script, navigate to the `doc/` directory and run it using bash:

```bash
cd doc
bash run_to_validate.sh
```

Or run it from the project root:

```bash
bash doc/run_to_validate.sh
```

## `doc/run_to_validate_errors.log`

All output from the `run_to_validate.sh` script, including any errors encountered during its execution, is automatically logged to the `doc/run_to_validate_errors.log` file.

### Checking for Errors

After running the `run_to_validate.sh` script, you can check the `doc/run_to_validate_errors.log` file to review the execution details and identify any potential issues.

For example, you can view the entire log:

```bash
cat doc/run_to_validate_errors.log
```

Or search for specific error messages:

```bash
grep -i "error" doc/run_to_validate_errors.log
```

This log file is crucial for troubleshooting and ensuring that the environment has been set up correctly.
